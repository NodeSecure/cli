<h1>hasNoLicense</h1>
<p>
    This flag mean that we have not detected any licenses in the npm Tarball (or
    something went wrong in the detection). For detecting licenses we are reading
    the <b>package.json</b> and searching for local files that contain the word <b>license</b>.
</p>
<br />
<p>
    The code and logic behind the detection is handled in the <a href="https://github.com/fraxken/npm-tarball-license-parser">npm-tarball-license-parser</a> package.
</p>
<br />
<p>
    For more information on how license must be described in the package.json,
    please check the
    <a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json#license" rel="nofollow"
        >npm documentation</a
    >.

<p class="note">
    ⚠️ we are working to stabilize this flag !
