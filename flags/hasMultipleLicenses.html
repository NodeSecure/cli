<h1>hasMultipleLicenses</h1>
<p>
    We have detected different licenses in <b>package.json</b> and
    other licenses files (<b>LICENSE</b>,
    <b>LICENSE.MD</b> etc). This probably means that there is an
    inconsistency in the choice of the license (or a file not updated yet with
    the right license).
</p>
<br />
<p>
    This flag has not been created to detect multiple licenses / conformance rules.
</p>
<p>Example: <span>ISC OR GPL-2.0-with-GCC-exception</span>.</p>
<br />
<p>
    Under the hood we use <a href="https://github.com/cutenode/conformance#readme">conformance</a> to parse licenses !
