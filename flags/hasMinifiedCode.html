<h1>hasMinifiedCode</h1>
<p>
    Has one or many files that has been detected as minified JavaScript code. We
    use a package that will tell us if the code is minified (in case the file as
    a <b>.min</b> then we will consider the file minified by default).
</p>
<br />
<p>
    Minified JavaScript code are commonly used by hacker to obfuscate the code
    to avoid being spotted. A good practice is surely to check all the packages
    with the flag.
</p>
<br />
<p>Example of minified code:</p>

<p class="note">
    ⚠️ sometimes one line file are considered minified (we are working to fix this in the future).
</p>
<br />
<p>Under the hood we use the npm package <a href="https://github.com/MartinKolarik/is-minified-code/">is-minified-code</a>.</p>
<br />
<p>Files can be found in the <b>Minified Files</b> list items of the left menu.</p>
