## üìù Command `open`

The `open` command reads a specified JSON payload and starts a local HTTP server. This allows you to explore dependencies, their metrics, and potential threats directly in your web browser.

## üìú Syntax

```bash
$ nsecure open [json]
```

> [!NOTE]
> If the `[json]` property is omitted, the command will default to searching for a `nsecure-result.json` file in the current working directory.
> If no `nsecure-result.json` file is found, it will behave as same as with `--fresh-start` option.
